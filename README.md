# Turtlenetes: the stupid turtle swarm

Turtlenetes is a client-server architecture for managing large swarms of turtles

The project is in its infancy (and by that I mean it's barely functional) so contributions would be greatly appreciated

# Usage

Attach a modem and disk drive to your computer: insert the turtle into the drive, place the turtle somewhere, run server.lua, and type "{functionName = "ping"},
you should get a response of "pong"
